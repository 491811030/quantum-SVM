# quantum-SVM
The quantum version of support vector machine using QuTip.

Reference: Li, Zhaokai, et al. "Experimental realization of a quantum support vector machine." Physical review letters 114.14 (2015): 140504.

After installing QuTip, the files "circuit.py and gates.py" in folder qutip/models are replaced by the corresponding files in this repository.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. I'm looking forward to hearing from any suggestions for further improvement. :)
